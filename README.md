# ComputeFidyah
A decade's worth of work on Fidyah Calculator for Singapore. Try it at https://hazrulazhar.github.io/computefidyah/

ComputeFidyah v1.0, created 6th October 2004
ComputeFidyah v2.0, updated 11th November 2004
ComputeFidyah v3.0, updated 27th July 2011
ComputeFidyah v4.0, updated 28th April 2014
ComputeFidyah v5.0, updated 15 May 2018

This application is based on Fidyah Calculator, created by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura
(http://www.muis.gov.sg/english/Fidyah_Calculator/Fidyah_Calculator.aspx?pMenu=5) . However, the
application which this software is based on, is only accurate up to 80 years of Ramadhan.
ComputeFidyah is 100% accurate and can calculate Fidyah for an infinite number of years. This software can
run on any Javascript-enabled web browser on any platform.

[New update on Muis Fidyah Calculator, 11th November 2004]
Muis has updated its Fidyah Calculator to a similar version of ComputeFidyah 1.0. It is cross browser and
cross platform but not cross medium, which means it cannot be viewed on mobile phones and pdas properly. The
new calculator can be found at (http://www.muis.gov.sg/eservices/fidyah_online.aspx). However, the new calculator
has some lacks which still makes ComputeFidyah 2.0 much more superior.

* Muis Fidyah Calculator runs on the server-side and uses a Javascript postback method which ruins the flow of
the user. This confuses the user temporarily.

* Because it requires a postback method, calling the server several times, the flow is slower. ComputeFidyah 2.0
is much faster because it is run completely on the client side.

[Efforts taken to get mass use of ComputeFidyah 2.0]
The mass use of ComputeFidyah 2.0 will allow the high possibility of syndication. Singapore mosques, or
people with personal homepages may add this calculator to their homepages if Muis adopts the software
and have higher confidence of its calculation accountability. A working syndication example can be found at
(http://www.mosque.org.sg/ghufran/services/zakat.htm).

[New update on Muis Fidyah Calculator, 10 May 2018]
It seems MUIS have updated their fidyah calculator this year in 2018 after over a decade of convincing them. They didn't use my code, but I'm just glad it's finally in JavaScript. It's now smooth and responsive.
