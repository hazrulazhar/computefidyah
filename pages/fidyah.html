    <div class="block block-strong">
      <p>When someone is not able to fast in Ramadan and cannot make them up afterwards (primarily due to ill health or pregnancy) they need to pay for someone else to be fed.</p>

    <div class="block-title">Fasting Qadha' Guide</div>
    <div class="block block-strong">
      <p>The ruling on repaying (qadha’) missed fast in Ramadhan falls under 3 categories:</p>

      <p>1. COMPULSORY REPAYMENT (WAJIB QADHA')<br />
        <ul>
          <li>Those who are ill and whose illness may worsen or the healing process may be delayed if one fasts.</li>
          <li>Those who travelled (musafir) approximately 84km or more.</li>
          <li>Pregnant women or those who are breastfeeding and are worried of their own well-being.</li>
          <li>Those in a state of nifas or haid.</li>
          <li>Those who are too hungry or thirsty to the extent that it may harm one’s self.</li>
          <li>Those whose fast was invalidated by one of the conditions that invalidate fast.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>2. COMPULSORY FIDYAH PAYMENT BUT NO NEED TO REPAY FAST (WAJIB FIDYAH)<br />
        <ul>
          <li>Those in a state of critical illness, unable to fast and whose hopes of healing are very slim.</li>
          <li>Those who are very weak and unable to fast due old age.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>3. COMPULSORY REPAYMENT AND FIDYAH (WAJIB QADHA' AND FIDYAH)<br />
      <ul>
        <li>Pregnant or breastfeeding women who are worried of the child’s well-being.</li>
        <li>Those who have not repaid their fast from the previous Ramadhan until the next Ramadhan arrives.</li>
      </ul>
